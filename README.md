### Workload Types

* load balanced web service
* backend service - isolated to private VPC that is accessible to frontend web app (load balanced web service)
* scheduled job

### Concepts

* Application - a group of related services, environments, and pipelines
* Environments - environment can have its own version of a service running allowing you to create a "test" and "production" environment
* Service - your code and all of the supporting infrastructure needed to get it up and running on AWS
* Jobs - ephemeral ECS tasks that are triggered by an event.  uses CloudWatch's rate expressions.  Scheduled Jobs are composed of an AmazonECS Task Definition, Task Role, Task Execution Role, a Step Function State Machine for retrying on failures, and finally an Event Rule to trigger the state machine.
* Pipelines - release pipeline that deploys your service whenever you push to your git repository. (At this time, Copilot supports GitHub, Bitbucket, and CodeCommit repositories.) When a push is detected, your pipeline will build your service, push the image to ECR, and deploy to your environments.
### Notes

* copilot cli automatically creates thw following stacks
    * `aws-copilot-playground-infrastructure-roles` stack
